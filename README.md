twitter-web-client
==================

Twitter web client application is a simple twitter REST api consumer written completely in javascript.
On the server side there is thin integration written with express.js.

On the frontend I've used Backbone which is great framework for developing single page apps, requirejs for amd and SASS bootstrap for UI.

This is also great example how to integrate yeoman with express.js, using the latest version of yeoman and grunt-express.
It provides also an example configuration of mocha for requirejs amd.
